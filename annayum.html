      <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Romance / Drama</p>
      <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 2h 47m</p>
      <p><strong>Release Year:</strong> 2013</p>
      <p>Annayum Rasoolum – A Tender Love Story Etched in Fort Kochi’s Soul
Directed by Rajeev Ravi (2013)</p>

<p>Rajeev Ravi’s Annayum Rasoolum is not just a love story — it’s a deeply atmospheric film that immerses us into the layered textures of Fort Kochi. With masterful direction and an eye for raw realism, Ravi lets the city become a silent yet ever-present character, one that breathes, lingers, and observes.</p>

<p>The cinematography, helmed by Ravi himself, is exceptional. Every frame feels lived-in and natural — the narrow streets, the ferry rides, the muted colors of old buildings, the wet pavements after a drizzle — all come together to paint a vivid portrait of Fort Kochi’s soul. It's not overly polished, and that's exactly what makes it so real.</p>

<p>At the heart of the film are Anna and Rasool, two quiet souls navigating an interfaith love that simmers gently rather than explodes. Fahadh Faasil brings Rasool to life with remarkable restraint — his emotions surface in small gestures and glances rather than dramatic monologues. Andrea Jeremiah as Anna is equally compelling, portraying strength and vulnerability in equal measure. The chemistry between them is understated, communicated mostly through silence and longing — a rare feat that only actors of such caliber can pull off. They don’t just act; they speak through their eyes, carrying the weight of unsaid words and emotional barriers.<p>

<p>Sunny Wayne’s character, as Rasool’s friend and our narrator, is a quiet observer of this story. His narration adds not only context but emotional weight — grounding the film with subtle commentary and warmth. His presence lends a second voice to the narrative, making us feel like we’re hearing this tale from someone who lived it.</p>

<p>In the end, Annayum Rasoolum is a simple yet powerful journey, a tale of love that unfolds without fanfare but leaves the heart heavy. It’s a film that respects silence, understands longing, and trusts the viewer to feel without being told. Rajeev Ravi’s brilliance lies in telling a story that’s both specific in setting and universal in emotion.</p>
